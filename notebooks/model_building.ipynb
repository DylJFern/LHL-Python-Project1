    "##### R-squared\n",
    "R-squared (also known as the coefficient of determination) represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable \"total_bikes\" that is predictable from the inpendent variables \"fsq_avg_rating\", \"fsq_avg_distance\", \"yelp_avg_rating\", \"yelp_avg_distance\". The higher the R-squared value (range: from 0 to 1), the better our model fits the data. In other words, it is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model. For this specific model output, approximately 50.6% of the variability in the total number of bikes at a station can be explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adjusted R-squared\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is similar to R-squared but accounts for the number of predictor variables in the model. Unlike R-squared which tends to increase with the addition of more predictors, even if they don't significantly contribute to explaining the variation in the dependent variable, adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary variables. For this specific model, the adjusted R-squared is 50% which means it can explain about half of the variability, considering the trade-off between model complexity (number of predictor variables) and goodness of fit.\n",

    "##### F-statistic and Prob (F-statistic)\n",
    "The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the regression model, it assess whether at least one independent variable significantly impacts the dependent variable. The higher the F-statistic the better the indication of the overall fit of the model. The Prob (F-statistic) is the probability associated with the F-statistic, a low p-value (< 0.05) indicates that the overall model is statistically significant.\n",

    "##### coef\n",
    "For coef's, the const (intercept) represents the value of \"total_bikes\" when all independent variables are 0. For each 1-meter increase in \"fsq_avg_rating\" and \"yelp_avg_rating\" we expect an approximate increase of 886.7350 and 259.3661 in the total number of bikes, respectively. This means higher ratings are associated with more bikes. For each 1-meter increase in \"fsq_avg_distance (m)\" and \"yelp_avg_distance (m)\" we expect an approximate decrease of 1.0372 and 0.5340 in the total number of bikes, respectively. This means that greater distances (from station and place) are associated with fewer bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### t and P>|t|\n",
    "Statistical significance can be provided by t-statistics and associated p-values (P>|t|). Small p-values (less than 0.05 for our analysis) suggest that the predictor is statistically significant, in such a case we reject the null hypothesis. In the context of this problem, the null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no relationship or influence of that predictor on the total number of bikes. However, for all columns we can see that their p-values are less than 0.05, this means that the independent variables are statistically significant in predicting the total number of bikes (the dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Skew and Kurtosis\n",
    "Skew is a measure of symmetry of the distribution, in our case the skewness of 1.530 suggests that the distribution is moderately skewed to the right. Kurtosis is a measure of the sharpness of the distribution, a high positive kurtosis indicates heavy tails and a peaky distribution, in this context, the distribution contains more outliers or extreme values compared to a normal distribution."
